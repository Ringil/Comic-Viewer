##Comic Viewer
A, work in progress, python .cbr and .cbz reader.
Currently requires PIL (Python Imaging Library), Qt, PyQt and Python 2.7, rarfile.

Once the previous requirements are met you simply type in the console:
./ComicViewer path/to/your/comic

Good News! Although the interface is just a label currently, you can now actually go back and forth through the pages by using a few hotkeys.

The current hotkeys are:
Next Page: Spacebar or Enter or Click on the current page/image
Previous Page: Backspace
