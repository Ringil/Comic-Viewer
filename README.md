##Comic Viewer
A, work in progress, python .cbr and .cbz reader.
Currently requires PIL (Python Imaging Library), Qt, PyQt and Python 2.7, rarfile.

#Getting Started
Once the previous requirements are met you simply type in the console:
./ComicViewer path/to/your/comic

The file axe.cbz has been provided for testing purposes but it only contains 1 image.
In this case you would use ./ComicViewer axe.cbz

#Hotkeys
Good News! Although the interface is just a label currently, you can now actually go back and forth through the pages by using a few hotkeys.
